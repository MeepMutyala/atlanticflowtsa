        <h1> MOT Charter High TSA</h1>  
        Our Technology Student Association chapter meets once a week till the competition date where we work on our events and collaborate with each other in a safe, nurturing, and knowledgeable environment. Our chapter officers are committed into proper organization and making sure everyone has fun while succeeding in their event. Students are also scheduled to work after school if needed to work on their event. Over the course of the years our chapter has existed, our chapter has been growing constantly. It has also been home to state officers, as well as state and national winners. Though we are a relatively new chapter, each one of us are committed to strive for the best in each of our events and succeed in the technical world.

        <h1>Community Service</h1>
        The TSA Chapter at MOT has organized Relay For Life fundraisers, in order to raise fundings for cancer research and patients. 

        The MOT TSA Chapter has also planned and organized American Cancer Society fundraisers such as Penny Wars to engage students and raise money for ACS.

        Our school has promoted and funded a charity known as B+, which provides funding to families of children suffering from cancer, allowing the children to get necessary treatment. The organization also funds cancer research and medical facilities that treat cancer patients. 

        Many students at our school also go out of their way to organize community service events. One such program is called the Hero H.U.G.S. This program collects school supplies for less fortunate children. The supplies then get donated to the Ministry of Caring children facilities across Delaware.
